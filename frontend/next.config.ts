/**
 * Next.js config of a Silicon app's web frontend, built from the web kit.
 *
 * Topology: this site is a BFF ("backend for frontend"). The browser only ever talks to this origin; the Next server
 * holds the account's Silicon Accounts tokens in a sealed httpOnly cookie and calls the app's own service itself:
 *   /api/*          → ${APP_API_URL}/* with Authorization: Bearer (app/api/[...path]/route.ts)
 *   /auth/sign-in   → the hosted sign-in on ${ACCOUNTS_URL}/authorize (PKCE S256, state in a sealed cookie)
 *   /auth/callback  → exchanges the code with the app secret, seals the tokens into the session cookie
 *   /auth/sign-out  → revokes the refresh token and clears the cookie
 * No rewrites and nothing from the environment at build time: every value is read per request (lib/server/env.ts), so
 * one build serves any stack.
 *
 * NEXT_DIST_DIR gives a build its own directory (`.next-<name>`), so the e2e run never shares a build with `next dev`.
 * NEXT_OUTPUT=standalone builds a self-contained server for self-hosting (Vercel needs nothing).
