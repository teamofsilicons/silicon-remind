 * Where focus goes when a layer (Dialog, Drawer, the command palette) closes: back to what opened it (WCAG 2.4.3).
 *
 * Radix returns focus to its own <Dialog.Trigger>. Our layers are mostly opened from plain state (a button that sets
 * `open`, a keyboard shortcut, a command), so there is no Trigger, and Radix then cancels its focus scope's own return
 * and focuses nothing: focus fell to <body> after every Escape. `useLayerOpener` remembers the element that had focus
 * when `open` turned true (read while rendering that change, before the layer mounts and a field inside it takes focus),
 * and `returnFocusTo` gives Radix an `onCloseAutoFocus` that puts focus back there.
